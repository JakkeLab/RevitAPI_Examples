<H1>Get Count of Elements</H1>
This folder includes the sample code of 'Collecting element informations without activating document(rvt file)'.<br/>
This code does task of counting 'Structural Columns'.<br/><br/>

Originally, I've written this code for comparing the count of specific element between two RVT Files.<br/>
And estimate them, which one is removed or newly created, by comparing the activated document and selected RVT File that not opened on Revit.
(like "COMPARE" command in AutoCAD)
